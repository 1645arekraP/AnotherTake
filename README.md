# AnotherTake
A UGAHacks project which allows you to play around with audio effects using just your voice!

## Team
Sumedh Garimella, Georgia Institute of Technology
Parker Arneson, Denmark High School
Noah Sivinski, University of Georgia

## What AnotherTake does
Our bot uses the Twilio API to take in voice messages, process them using various audio effects, and return them to the user 

## Inspiration
Sumedh is a Music Technology minor at Georgia Tech, and many of the audio effects used were effects he learned how to reproduce in Python through his MUSI 2526 course. 
He has also worked with Twilio chatbots as part of previous projects at PennApps and Georgia Tech.  
He decided to work on a project that combined his two loves of computing and music into a fun hackathon project.
